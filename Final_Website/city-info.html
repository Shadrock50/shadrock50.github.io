        <h2>History of Fort Bridger</h2>
        <p>Fort Bridger was originally a 19th-century fur trading outpost established in 1842, on Blacks Fork of the Green River, in what is now Uinta County, Wyoming, United States. It became a vital resupply point for wagon trains on the Oregon Trail, California Trail, and Mormon Trail. The Army established a military post here in 1858 during the Utah War, until it was finally closed in 1890. The fort was not very glamorous, it was even a disappointment to most travelers. It was simply two log cabins about 40 feet in length connected by a fence to hold horses. Most visitors complained about insufficient supplies and it being over priced. They did, however, have a blacksmith's shop that many travelers took advantage of.
            By 1858, Fort Bridger became a military outpost. Today, Fort Bridger is a historic site. Jim Bridgerâ€™s trading post is reconstructed, along with other historic buildings from the military. There is also a museum with gift shops available for visitors.</p>
