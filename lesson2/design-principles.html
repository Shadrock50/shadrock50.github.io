            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <p>Amazon</p>

            <p>The Amazon site follows Hick's law in helping guide the user to making decisions. It has relatively few links when compared to the entire site. 
                And each set of links is sectioned off into specific subject. This ensures that the user will be able to find what they are looking for before navigating to more complicated areas of the site.

            <img src="youtube.png" alt="Youtube Screenshot">
            <p>The size and location of each link in Youtube's site is spot on. They are large enough to be noticeable, and all centered around where the cursor would go to make it 
                incredibly easy to reach quickly.

            <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
            <p>Squarespace</p>

            <p>
                Squarespace does a great job of utilizing the whitespace of a web page to make their website more simple, and more clean. There are few links on the homepage, but it clearly accentuates what the site is about and what you need to do to move forward. It's very well done.
